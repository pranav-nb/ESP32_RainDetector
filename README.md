<h5>NOTE: This is a simple IoT project implemented to give some ideas on what can be done with ESP32 and some simple components </h5>

The project is a demonstration of a door which can be controlled through the Internet using a telegram bot. A rain sensor is interfaced to get some input. The input is taken and based on it a command is sent to produce an action. <br>

To learn about telegram bots visit https://core.telegram.org/bots <br>
Arduino IDE is used to program the ESP32 mainly because it is simple for beginners to understand.
<br> Servo motor is used as a similie to the door.
